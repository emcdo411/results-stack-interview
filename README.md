## 🚀 Proposed POS Integration Upgrade — Pinto Ranch Scenario

This hypothetical project simulates what Maurice can contribute at ResultStack.

### 🎯 Objective

To provide a future-ready, QA-driven POS system upgrade for a retail brand (e.g., Pinto Ranch), migrating from a legacy POS to Shopify with QA automation, UAT validation, and integration with internal CRM and payment APIs.

## 🔍 Highlighted QA Projects

### 1. **BrisketSentinel**

* **Use Case:** Simulates smoking logs with PowerShell + RShiny
* **Value:** AI detects cancer thresholds and triggers alerts — shows ability to log/test physical variables

### 2. **Swagger Log Monitor (Vite Build)**

* **Use Case:** Full-stack Swagger-tested API logger rebuilt in Vite
* **Value:** End-to-end API validation and Swagger-based testing shows proactive engineering

## 💡 Key Talking Points for ResultStack Interview

* "At Pinto Ranch, I wasn't just a sales associate—I proactively built diagrams and researched Shopify POS upgrades. That same mindset is what I’d bring to ResultStack."
* "At WPP, all of our QA documentation and GitHub migration planning happened inside JIRA—so I’m fluent in using tickets as the single source of truth."
* "I've built dashboards that test, alert, and explain—automated log monitoring, regression flagging, and real-time data visuals."

---

## 📈 STAR Example

**Situation:** At D.R. Horton, QA testing was behind schedule for a critical CRM workflow.
**Task:** Validate mortgage-linked CRM logic across multiple systems.
**Action:** Prioritized critical test cases, coordinated with devs, conducted joint UAT.
**Result:** On-time release with <1% post-launch issues.
